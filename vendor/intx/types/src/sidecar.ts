/**
 * Categories of deploy-apply failure surfaced by the sidecar's
 * tool-package loader. Each value maps one-to-one to a distinct point in
 * the apply pipeline; a single category fires per failed attempt.
 *
 *   tarball.missing          — a manifest entry's asset-sourced tarball
 *                              is not present at the recorded path.
 *   asset.mount.missing      — a `kind: "asset"` manifest entry names
 *                              an `assetId` that the deploy pack's
 *                              `deploy/asset-mounts.json` does not
 *                              cover. Indicates a mismatch between the
 *                              resolver's view of attached assets and
 *                              the materialization fan-out, not a
 *                              missing file on disk.
 *   integrity.mismatch       — fetched tarball bytes do not match the
 *                              manifest's pinned SRI integrity.
 *   registry.fetch.failed    — the configured registry refused or
 *                              dropped the request for a tarball.
 *   registry.unknown         — the manifest entry references a registry
 *                              name not present in the sidecar's
 *                              registry config.
 *   registry.auth.failed     — the registry rejected the sidecar's
 *                              credentials.
 *   tarball.extract.failed   — tar extraction failed or the extracted
 *                              tree was malformed.
 *   git.materialization.failed
 *                            — a git-sourced entry could not be
 *                              materialized from its checked-out
 *                              subtree, or reached a loader that does
 *                              not materialize git sources.
 *   manifest.invalid         — the manifest itself did not validate
 *                              at the loader boundary (JSON.parse
 *                              failure or arktype schema failure).
 *                              Peer-dependency violations are caught
 *                              earlier by the hub's resolver and
 *                              surface as a launch failure rather
 *                              than this frame.
 *   package.entry.missing    — a top-level package's package.json had
 *                              no `interchange.tools` field.
 *   package.entry.invalid    — the resolved `interchange.tools` module
 *                              exported nothing that looked like an
 *                              AnnotatedToolFactory.
 *   factory.construct.failed — a factory invocation threw, or required
 *                              a capability key the env did not provide.
 *   tool.name.duplicate      — a tool name is registered more than
 *                              once in the apply's loaded set. The
 *                              cross-bundle case (two pinned packages
 *                              share a bundle id, producing colliding
 *                              prefixed tool names) is rejected at
 *                              apply time, before the caller commits.
 *                              The intra-bundle case (one package
 *                              exports two definitions sharing a raw
 *                              name) surfaces at first agent
 *                              construction with the same category
 *                              instead of apply rejection: the loader
 *                              cannot see `bundle.definitions` without
 *                              invoking the factory, and the `BaseEnv`
 *                              the factory needs is constructed by the
 *                              workflow child's step build env AFTER
 *                              the commit. Both paths carry the same
 *                              category so the operator-facing failure
 *                              shape is uniform regardless of which
 *                              check fired; only the channel
 *                              (apply.error frame vs runtime construct
 *                              failure) differs.
 *   apply.swap.failed        — DEPRECATED, no longer emitted. The apply
 *                              protocol stages each deploy into a stable
 *                              per-deploy-id directory and commits via a
 *                              single `active-deploy-id` file write, so
 *                              there is no filesystem rename that can
 *                              fail. The value is retained in the enum
 *                              for wire compatibility: during a rolling
 *                              upgrade an older sidecar can still emit
 *                              it, and dropping the member would make a
 *                              newer hub's frame validator reject that
 *                              frame.
 *   apply.previous-rotation.failed
 *                            — every loaded factory validated and the
 *                              new deploy was staged, but persisting the
 *                              instance's `active-deploy-id` file (the
 *                              commit) degraded: the id was written
 *                              through the no-fsync / dirty-marker
 *                              fallback ladder rather than durably
 *                              flushed. The new deploy is logically
 *                              live, so `previousDeployId` on this
 *                              failure carries the NEW deploy id rather
 *                              than the pre-apply one. The next boot
 *                              reconciles the recorded id from the dirty
 *                              marker.

/**
 * Hub asks a connected sidecar to probe a code-sourced workflow. Correlated by
 * `requestId`; the sidecar answers with `workflow.probe.result` on success or
 * `workflow.probe.error` on failure, both carrying the same `requestId`.
 *
 * The frame carries everything the sidecar's probe child needs to run the
 * probe with no further hub round-trip:
 *   - `source` names where the definition's bytes come from (a registry, a
 *     package-registry asset, or a git asset).
 *   - `closure` is the frozen dependency closure the hub already resolved --
 *     concrete versions and integrity SRIs -- so the child materializes the
 *     exact tree the hub pinned.
 *   - `entry` is the `interchange.workflow` module path within the package
 *     whose evaluation produces the `WorkflowDefinition`.
 *   - `assets` (optional) delivers the hub assets a `kind:"asset"` closure
 *     entry reads from, inline. Delivery is inline rather than a separate
 *     streamed transfer (as the deploy path uses) because the probe is a
 *     single-shot request that already buffers the whole frame -- streaming
 *     would only add a transfer-vs-probe correlation state a one-shot has no
 *     use for. The sidecar caps the total inline payload and fails loud past
 *     it; a git-sourced asset that grows past that cap is the trigger to
 *     revisit streaming.
