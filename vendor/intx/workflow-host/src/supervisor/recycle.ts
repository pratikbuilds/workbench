// =============================================================
// RECYCLE -- workflow-process supervisor library code
// =============================================================
//
// Recycle is the supervisor's "same deploy tree, fresh process" path.
// It tears the existing workflow-process child down and stands a new
// one up against the SAME deploy tree (same materialized source
// closure, same per-step credential repos). It is STRICTLY ORTHOGONAL
// TO REDEPLOY:
//
//   - Recycle  = same deploy tree, fresh process.
//   - Redeploy = new deploy tree.
//
// Recycle does not refetch the deploy tree, does not consult an
// updated workflow definition, does not re-resolve agents. If a
// deploy-tree change is needed the host runs redeploy, which is a
// different code path with different authorization and a different
// rollback shape. The recycle module must never grow a "maybe also
// refetch the deploy tree" mode -- that would erase the orthogonality
// and let a recycle silently turn into a redeploy.
//
// Six-step sequence (locked):
//
// The `drain` step and the `SubprocessHandle` handed in as `current` are
// caller-parameterized. For the operator/policy/self recycle origins the
// child is live: `drain` sends the real drain control mail and `kill`
// terminates a running process. For the `crash` origin the child has
// already exited unexpectedly, so the caller supplies a no-op `drain`
// (there is nothing to drain) and the `kill` in step 2 lands on an
// already-dead handle as a cheap no-op. Steps 3-6 are identical for every
// origin.
//
//   1. `drain` -- send the existing drain control mail. Wait for
//      in-flight runs to drain per each step's `drainBehavior`.
//      `drainTimeout` escalation applies normally; the drain-timeout
//      accumulator and its `CancelRequested{origin: "supervisor-drain"}`
//      commit path are unchanged from the standalone-drain case.
//   2. `kill` -- terminate the workflow-process child cleanly. SIGTERM
//      first; if the child does not exit within the kill-timeout, the
//      handle's `kill(SIGKILL)` lands the hard stop. The supervisor's
//      injected subprocess spawner returns the child-handle API used
//      here; the recycle path does not reach into Node primitives.
//   3. `respawn` -- mint a new 16-byte hex channelId (the same shape
//      the initial spawn uses, per `generateChannelId`), generate a
//      fresh 32-byte HMAC key, re-read per-step credentials via the
//      injected `RepoStore`, and spawn a new Bun child via the same
//      subprocess-spawner binding. The new IPC anchors flow through
//      spawn-time env exactly as the initial spawn's anchors did.
//   4. `self-discover` -- the new child runs its existing self-
//      discovery on spawn. The recycle path does not coordinate this
//      step; it is the child's responsibility.
//   5. `resume` -- self-discovery resumes any in-flight runs from the
//      workflow-run log. The runtime body's seed-events path re-arms
//      timers, pending awaits, and uncancelled children.
//   6. Buffered mail is the supervisor's FIFO inbox claim-check queue
//      (the new child's dispatch loop picks up entries that arrived
//      during the kill/respawn gap once it starts). The recycle path
//      does NOT drain an in-memory mail buffer; every inbound message
//      enqueues into the substrate-backed inbox regardless of phase.
//
// Mail-address ownership across the gap: the supervisor holds the
// mail-bus registration across the recycle via the injected mail-bus
// binding. No re-register, no unregister. Inbound mail during the
// gap commits to the substrate-backed inbox; the new child's dispatch
// loop dequeues in arrival order (the envelope's `receivedAt` prefix
// preserves FIFO discipline across the gap).
//
// Before the kill lands the recycle path calls
// `ctx.replayProcessingToInbox()` so any in-flight `processing/`
// entries that the dying cohort's dispatch loop did not reach
// `markConsumed` for get moved back to `inbox/` under their original
// `<receivedAt>-<messageId>` keys. Without this step the dying child
// would leave an orphaned processing entry that no live dispatch
// loop owns.
//
// Three trigger origins funnel through `triggerRecycle(reason, ctx)`:
//
//   - Operator command -- the host receives a `recycle` request via
//     its caller-facing API and routes it to the supervisor's
//     `recycle()` method, which delegates here.
//   - Supervisor policy -- a periodic check (every ~minute) consults
//     configurable bounds (max-uptime, max-rss, grants-staleness;
//     defaults unlimited). On a threshold trip the policy calls
//     `triggerRecycle` with a reason tagged with the tripped bound.
//   - Workflow-process self-initiated -- the child sends a
//     `recycle.request` payload over control IPC. The supervisor's
//     upstream control-channel reader recognises the variant and
//     funnels it here.
//
// All three origins land in the same code path. The reason string is
// the only origin-specific data the path carries forward.
