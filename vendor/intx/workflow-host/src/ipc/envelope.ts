// Frame envelope shared by both IPC channels.
//
// Every signed/HMACed frame carries `{ seq, channelId, payload }`
// inside the bytes the receiver authenticates. `seq` is a monotonic
// u64 counter the sender maintains per channel; `channelId` is the
// 16-byte hex identity the supervisor mints at every spawn and rotates
// at every recycle; `payload` is the channel-specific JSON value.
//
// Wire shape on disk for the control channel: one NDJSON line per
// frame, each line `{ envelope: <canonical-json-of-envelope>, sig:
// <hex Ed25519 signature> }`. For the event channel: a 4-byte big-
// endian length prefix, then `{ envelope, mac }` JSON in the same
// shape with `mac` carrying the hex HMAC tag. Both wires sign the
// canonical-JSON serialization of the envelope as a single bytestring.
// The on-wire byte representation of the envelope is exactly what the
// signer signs and the verifier verifies.
//
// Canonical JSON: keys appear in fixed insertion order (seq,
// channelId, payload, then childRunId when the event channel set it). The payload's internal structure is preserved
// as the sender produced it; no recursive canonicalization is
// performed because the verifier never compares two structurally
// different serializations of the same logical value. Senders and
// receivers see the same bytes by construction (sender computes the
// signature over the exact serialization it then transmits; receiver
// verifies the signature over the exact bytes it received).
